# Hero Management API

## Introduction

This project is an API for managing heroes and their superpowers, using ASP.NET Core with Entity Framework Core. The application allows for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on heroes and their superpowers.

## Architecture

The application is organized into the following layers:
- **Controllers:** Contains the API controllers that handle HTTP requests and return the appropriate responses.
- **Domain:** Contains the domain entities and repository interfaces.
- **Infrastructure:** Contains the repository implementations and the database context.

## Technologies Used

- ASP.NET Core
- Entity Framework Core
- AutoMapper

## Features

- **PostHero:** Adds a new hero and their associated superpowers to the database.
- **GetHeroes:** Returns a list of all heroes.
- **GetHero:** Returns a specific hero based on the ID.
- **PutHero:** Updates the information of an existing hero.

### SuperpowerController
